# Rick the Cucumber
  #### Ok, fellows, so here is my pat project called Rick the Cucumber. It is based on Rick and Morty TV show [API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/). It still on development stage. That mean that I continue to add new features and refactor it. So, as they say on TV, please, stand by.

  ### You may find DEMO link here: [DEMO LINK](https://rick-the-cucumber.vercel.app/)

  ## This project was created with:
  - Next.js
  - Redux
  - Tailwind CSS
  - DaisyUI
  - his majesty TypeScript

### How to use:
- On the home page, youâ€™re encouraged to search for your favorite TV show hero. Just type in the person's name, and you'll see all versions of them across different dimensions and crazy worlds.
- Swipe left and right to view all search results.
- To learn more about a person you've found, simply click on their name.
- You can also browse heroes from the TV show by clicking the 'Heroes' button. There are all of them, like 47 pages. No kidding.
- Want to know more about one of your favorite or weird heroes? Click on their card to see a special page with details such as their name, world of residence, dead or alive status, and a table - with all episodes featuring them.
- You can sort the episodes by title, air date, or season/episode code. Just click on the appropriate column header in the table.
- Click on an episode in the table to learn more about it. On the episode page, you will see information about the air date and cards of all heroes starring in that episode. Of course, the cards are clickable.
- Browse through the worlds of Rick and Morty adventures by clicking on the "Places" button. All worlds are clickable.
- Click on a world card to see more details, such as who lives there.
